If any errors occurs during code setup it is bcoz 1 of the jar is missing i.e servlet-api.jar you can find it in your apache-tomcat installation.
You can find the jar at dir apache-tomcat/bin u'll find the jars one of the jar is servlet-api.jar.
select it add it in to your build path libs.
And you were ready to go.

Note - If any other errors occurs except the above one then check ur tomcat version and ur java version.
       i.e if you are using java 8 you have to use tomcat verion between 8 or bigger then 8 i.e 8.5 0r 8.6 but not 9.
       
Thanks.
